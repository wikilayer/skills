# Changelog

## 0.4.0
- lint: add **Block thinner than its own title** — a leaf whose body says no more than its heading already said should be folded into a neighbour, not kept as a node. A rendered heading above a single sentence reads as a defect, and it costs an outline row on top of the whitespace.
- lint: the **Opaque title** check no longer implies that widening the title is the fix. A title narrower than its body has two repairs, splitting the body or narrowing the promise, and reaching for the third one empties the body and produces the new check above.

## 0.3.0
- lint: add two checks — **Tombstone block** (a block that documents its own obsolescence instead of being deleted) and **Editorial date stamp** (an authorship/freshness date the node's `updated_at` already records).
- lint: cite the public anti-patterns page as the primary source, and note the checklist is duplicated in the skill on purpose so it runs self-contained against any instance (including a localhost one with no authoring guide).

## 0.2.0
- Marketplace install support (permanent install via `marketplace.json`); review frontmatter YAML fix.
